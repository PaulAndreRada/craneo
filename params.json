In other words - Here’s the skull, you supply the brain.\r\n\r\n\r\n###Install\r\nIf you have node.js installed you can simply use npm to download it.\r\n```bash \r\nnpm install craneo\r\n```\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\n##Quick Start\r\n\r\n###Create a response\r\nCreate a `hello-world.js` file inside the main directory.</br>\r\nThis function will serve as the first response your bot will have.\r\n```js\r\nvar helloWorld = function(context){\r\n  console.log( 'Hello world' );\r\n  return false\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = helloWorld;\r\n```\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n###Create a list for your responses\r\nIn order for the bot to read your response you'll need to create a `response-list.js` file.\r\nInside `response-list.js` create the main `responseList` array and import the `hello-world.js` response function into this file. It will serve as the root response list for all of your bot’s commands and responses.  \r\n```js\r\nvar helloWorld = require('./hello-world.js');\r\n\r\nvar responseList = [\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'helloWorld',\r\n    commands: [ /^(.*?(\\hello\\b)[^$]*)$/i ],\r\n    response: helloWorld\r\n  }\r\n]; \r\n\r\nmodule.exports = responseList;\r\n```\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n### Create a commands list for your response\r\nThe `commands` property inside a response object is an array that can be supplied any regular expressions. </br>Craneo uses these expressions to match any command supplied by the user with a response function of your choosing. \r\n</br> By adding the regular expression `/^(.*?(\\hello\\b)[^$]*)$/i` inside the command array, we are connecting any messages with the word \"hello\" to the `helloWorld` function.\r\n\r\n### Listen to messages\r\nIn your main app folder require Craneo along with your `response-list.js` file.\r\n```js\r\nvar Craneo = require('craneo');\r\nvar responseList = require('./response-list');\r\n```\r\nInitiate your own instance of a Craneo by passing it your `responseList` array inside of an object with a property named responseList. \r\n```js\r\nvar bot = Craneo({ responseList: responseList }); \r\n```\r\nNow you're ready to listen to any message by calling the listen method inside your bot and passing it a message and any arguments that you would like to be passed down to your response.\r\n```js\r\nbot.listen('hello');\r\n```\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\n## Response Types\r\n\r\n### Basic Response\r\nAs shown in our `hello-world.js` function, a basic response has a series of commands that can match with a users message to trigger a basic response function. These function types should return false. Returning false tells the bot to use the default `responseList` array for the following responses. As with all other response types a basic response will be passed a context argument with the objects bot and client.\r\n\r\n### Response Chain\r\nThink of a response chain as a conversation, once a response matches it returns a list or possible responses that are used instead of the default response.  This narrows the bot's available responses to a specific set of actions.  In order to end the response chain, provide a function with `return false`, this will tell Craneo to go back to using the default responseList.\r\n```js\r\nvar responseChain = function( context ){\r\n\r\n  // do your response’s action\r\n  console.log('A Response chain has started' );\r\n\r\n  // Return the following response objects to the bot in the same array format as the default response list\r\n  var responseList = [\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'foo',\r\n      response: function( context ){\r\n          console.log('foo, ending chain');\r\n          return false;\r\n      },\r\n      commands: [ /^(.*?(\\bfoo\\b)[^$]*)$/i ]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'bar',\r\n      response: function( context ){\r\n        console.log('bar, ending chain');\r\n        return false;\r\n      },\r\n      commands: [/^(.*?(\\bbar\\b)[^$]*)$/i]\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      name: 'commandNotFound',\r\n      response: function(){\r\n        console.log('command not found in chain');\r\n        return responseList;\r\n      },\r\n      commands: [],\r\n    }\r\n  ];\r\n\r\n  return responseList;\r\n}\r\n\r\nmodule.exports = responseChain;\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Read Chain\r\nA Read Chain is used when you want to parse a message in detail. By returning the string `’read’` inside of a response along with a `responseList` property inside that same object the bot will read the message supplied a second time. This time using the responseList supplied inside of the matching object. This can be done in multiple sequences in order to get the most accurate reading of a message. \r\n\r\n\r\n```js \r\nvar responseList = \r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'readChainExample',\r\n    response: 'read',\r\n    commands: [/^(.*?(\\bshow\\b)[^$]*)$/i],\r\n    responseList:\r\n    [\r\n      {\r\n        name: 'showSpaceInvaders',\r\n        response: function(context){\r\n          console.log('Space Invaders!');\r\n        },\r\n        commands: [/^(.*?(\\binvaders\\b)[^$]*)$/i],\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        name: 'showBreakout',\r\n        response: function(context){\r\n          console.log('Breakout!');\r\n          return false;\r\n        },\r\n        commands: [/^(.*?(\\bbreakout\\b)[^$]*)$/i],\r\n      },\r\n      {\r\n        name:'commandNotFound',\r\n        response: commandNotFound,\r\n        commands: []\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n]\r\n```\r\n### Important Note\r\nThe response list is read in order, repeating a command [regex formatting and context] will result in a matching of the first command of that type only. If there is a need for a command that reads `’Show Gundam Wing’` and a command in a different object that reads `’Show MSG’` then use a read chain with a command of `’show’` then pass it a response list that holds the `Gundam Wing` response object and the `MSG` response object; As shown in the example above. This will match the 'show' command first then re-read the same message in order to match the following command.\r\n\r\n\r\n</br></br>\r\n## General Docs\r\n### Passing down a context\r\nAll responses will get passed a context argument containing the bot's variables and the [your]client's arguments. The `context.bot` object will pass down the contents necessary for the bot to function; Mainly the message content `context.bot.message` and the current response list `context.bot.responseList`.  The `context.client` object will pass down whatever contents you pass to the bot’s `listen` method.\r\n```js\r\n// Make your own context variables\r\nvar responseArgs  = {\r\n  userId : ‘RX78G’, \r\n  name:  ‘Amuro Ray’\r\n  type: ‘Gundam’\r\n}\r\n// Pass them to the response\r\nbot.listen( ‘hello’, responseArgs );\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Command Not Found\r\nCraneo’s parser expects a response named `’commandNotFound’` inside any response list provided. This allows you to supply a custom function that will be triggered whenever the user adds a command that does not match with your response list’s options. This response should use the same formating as any other response object, but does not need any commands inside the commands array. \r\n\r\n```js\r\nvar responseList = [ \r\n  { \r\n   name: 'commandNotFound',\r\n   response: function(context){...},\r\n   commands: []\r\n  } \r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\nCreated by Paul Rada & Licensed under MIT\r\n",
