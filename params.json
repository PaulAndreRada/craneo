It will serve as your default bottle neck for all of your commands and responses.  \r\n```js\r\nvar helloWorld = require('./hello-world.js');\r\n\r\nvar responseList = [\r\n  {\r\n    name: 'helloWorld',\r\n    commands: [ /^(.*?(\\Hello\\b)[^$]*)$/i ],\r\n    response: hello,\r\n  }\r\n]; \r\n\r\nmodule.exports = responseList;\r\n```\r\n</br>\r\n\r\n### Create a commands list for your response\r\nThe `commands:` inside a response object must be supplied using regular expressions. </br>Craneo uses regular expresions to match any command supplied inside the command list with the received message.\r\n</br> By adding the regular expresion `/^(.*?(\\Hello\\b)[^$]*)$/i` inside our command list, we set up our bot to respond with our hello world function to any commands that include the string 'Hello'.\r\n\r\n### Listen to messages\r\nIn your main app folder you can require Craneo and your `response-list.js` file.\r\n```js\r\nvar Craneo = require('craneo');\r\nvar responseList = require('./response-list');\r\n```\r\nInitiate your own instance of a Craneo with by passing it your responseList array inside of an object. \r\n```js\r\nvar bot = Craneo({ responseList: responseList }); \r\n```\r\nNow you're ready to listen to any message by calling the listen method inside your bot and passing it a message and any arguments that you would like to be passed down to your response.\r\n```js\r\nbot.listen('hello');\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
